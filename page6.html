        <div class="bio-box">
            <p>If you want to learn more about Jesus Christ's church He has established today, you can do this by meeting with missionaries! They are young people (usually 18-25) who have dedicated 2 years of lives to sharing the gospel of Jesus Christ to people who want to learn about it. They can help you learn more about Him and how to follow Him. You can also visit the Church with them, they will sit with you and help you feel comfortable. Learn more about them by going to their website: <a href="https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/comeuntochrist/ps/meet-with-missionaries" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/comeuntochrist/ps/meet-with-missionaries</a></p>
            <p>As you learn more about Jesus Christ, you will find that He is the source of all truth and goodness. He can help you find peace, joy, and purpose in your life. You can also share what you learn with others, helping them to come closer to Him as well.</p>

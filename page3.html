        <div class="bio-box">
            <p>Jesus Christ is so important to learn about, and evenually believe. Because of Jesus’s atoning sacrifice, we can be forgiven and cleansed of our sins. Our hearts can be changed for the better as we repent. This makes it possible for us to return to God’s presence and receive a fulness of joy. He offers comfort, hope, and healing. His atoning sacrifice is the ultimate expression of His love. All that is unfair in life can be made right through the Atonement of Jesus Christ.</p>
            <p>Because of Jesus’s Resurrection, we will all be resurrected after we die. This means that each person’s spirit and body will be reunited, and each of us will live forever in a perfected, resurrected body. Although we are imperfect and may fall short again, there is more grace, love, and mercy in Jesus Christ than there is failure, flaw, or sin in us. God is always ready and eager to embrace us as we turn to Him and repent.</p>
            <p>As we rely on Jesus Christ and His Atonement, He can help us endure our trials, sicknesses, and pain. We can be filled with joy, peace, and consolation. All that is unfair about life can be made right through the Atonement of Jesus Christ. He matters because every aspect of our lives can be improved as we follow Him. </p>

        <h2>What You Can Do About It</h2>
        <div class="bio-box">
            <p>What can you do with this information? First, it's most important to try to grow your relationship with Jesus Christ. You can begin by praying to His father and our Heavenly Father. Because God is our Father, He will help us recognize truth when we pray with belief and real intent to know. God usually answers our prayers through the Holy Ghost. As we pray, the Holy Ghost teaches and confirms truth. Communications from the Holy Ghost are powerful. They usually come as a quiet assurance through our feelings, thoughts, and impressions.</p>
            <p>A prayer usually has 4 parts: Begin by addressing your Heavenly Father. Then, express the feelings of your heart, such as gratitude for the blessings you have received. Ask questions, seek guidance, and ask for blessings you need. Lastly, end by saying, “In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.” You can pray out loud or keep it in your heart. Many people feel it stronger when it is aloud.</p>
            <p>You can also read the words of Christ in the scriptures and try to find ways you can apply the principles He teaches. You can find His words in The Book of Mormon and the Old and New Testaments of the Bible. The beginning of the New Testament contains record of his actual ministry while on earth, and 3 Nephi in the Book of Mormon contains record of His teaching people after He was killed and resurrected. Those are good places to start.</p>
            <p>Finally, you can learn more about His church and the teachings of His Apostles by attending His church today! There are many churches around the world who will accept and welcome anyone. People usually wear formal clothes, but it is not required.

        <h2>His Teachings</h2>
        <div class="bio-box">
            <p>Jesus Christ's teachings in the scripture trancends the time period and contntues to help us today. Those who follow His teachings are called Christains, Saints, disciples, followers of Christ, and even Brothers and Sisters. Christ taught many principles, and much of them can be summed into 5 principles. This is called "The Doctrine Of Christ" or His "Gospel". </p>
            <p>The first principle is having Faith in Him. When we have faith in Jesus Christ, we have a relationship with Him, we trust in Him as the only Begotten Son of our Heavenly Father. Second, faith in Jesus Christ leads us to repentance. Repentance is is the process of turning to God and turning away from sin. As we repent, our actions, desires, and thoughts change to be more in harmony with God’s will. When we sincerely repent, God forgives us. Forgiveness is possible because Jesus Christ atoned for our sins. Repentance is a lifelong process. God welcomes us back every time we repent. He will never give up on us.</p>
            <p>The third principle of The Gospel of Jesus Christ is baptism. Faith in Jesus Christ and repentance prepare us for baptism. Baptism is how we first enter a covenant relationship with God. Baptism has two parts: baptism by water and by the Spirit. When we are baptized and confirmed, we are cleansed of our sins, giving us a new start in life. Each week, we partake of bread and water--called the sacrament--in remembrance of Jesus’s sacrifice and to renew our covenants with God. The fourth principle involves baptism by the sprit, otherwise called receiving the Gift of The Holy Ghost. When we receive the gift of the Holy Ghost, we can have His companionship throughout our lives if we are faithful. He guides us, comforts us, and helps us know the truth.</p>
            <p>Finally, the fifth principle is called Enduring To The End. Enduring includes continuing to exercise faith in Christ each day. We continue to keep our covenants with God, repent, seek the companionship of the Holy Ghost, and partake of the sacrament. As we faithfully seek to follow Jesus Christ, God promises that we will have eternal life and live with Him forever. This process of following the teachings of Christ deepens our joys, inspires our actions, and enriches our relationships. Families can be together forever in Heaven through it, and they are most likely to be happy when following these principles.</p>

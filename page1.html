        <h2>Biography of Jesus Christ</h2>
        <div class="bio-box">
            <p>God is our Heavenly Father, and He created us in His image. He knows us personally and loves us. He wants to bless us with peace and a fulness of joy that will last for eternity. Jesus Christ is the Son of God. His mission was to make it possible for us to be cleansed of our sins, overcome death, and receive eternal life. God calls prophets to be His representatives on earth. Anciently, He called prophets such as Adam, Noah, Abraham, and Moses. A living prophet receives revelation from God to teach and lead us today.</p>
            <p>Jesus Christ, also known as Jesus of Nazareth, is the central figure of Christianity. He was born around 4 BC in Bethlehem, Judea, and is believed to be the Son of God and the awaited Messiah (Christ) prophesied in the Old Testament. Jesus was born to Mary and Joseph, and his birth is celebrated annually on December 25th as Christmas. He grew up in Nazareth, a small town in Galilee, and began his public ministry around the age of 30. Jesus preached about the Kingdom of God, performed miracles, and taught through parables. His teachings emphasized love, compassion, forgiveness, and the importance of faith. Jesus' ministry lasted approximately three years, during which he gained a significant following. He was eventually arrested, tried, and crucified by the Roman authorities around AD 30-33. Christians believe that Jesus rose from the dead on the third day after his crucifixion, an event known as the Resurrection, which is celebrated on Easter Sunday. The life, death, and resurrection of Jesus Christ are the foundation of Christian faith and theology.</p>
            <p>During Jesus’s mortal ministry, He established His Church. After Jesus’s Apostles died, there was a widespread falling away from the gospel and Church of Jesus Christ. People changed many gospel teachings and priesthood ordinances, such as baptism.</p>

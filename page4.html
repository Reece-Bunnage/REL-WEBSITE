            <p>When Jesus walked upon the earth, He set up a church. The Church of Jesus Christ is built on the foundation of apostles and prophets. These leaders have divine priesthood authority. Through revelation they direct the affairs of the Church. They maintain doctrinal purity, authorize the administration of ordinances, and call and confer the priesthood authority upon others. Eventually, People rejected and killed Jesus Christ and the Apostles. With the death of the Apostles, the presiding priesthood authority was absent from the Church. Consequently, With the death of the Apostles, the presiding priesthood authority was absent from the Church. Consequently, There was no longer authority to baptize or to direct the Church.</p>
            <p>The Roman Empire, which at first had persecuted the Christians, later adopted Christianity. Important religious questions were settled by debate in councils rather than by revelation from God. Doctrine and ordinances were debated and changed to conform to worldly philosophies. Creeds, or statements of belief, were created based on the decisions of these councils.</p>
            <p>Some people tried to reform Christianity by correcting what existed. However, because God’s priesthood authority was not on the earth, a restoration of authority and truth was needed to reestablish the Church of Jesus Christ. When the circumstances were right, Heavenly Father once again reached out to His children in love. He called a young man named Joseph Smith as a prophet. Through him the fulness of the gospel of Jesus Christ was restored to the earth.</p>
            <p>Today this church is still active, and it will contain the fullness of Christs teachings and priesthood authority. The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints has Apostles today to lead His church just as Jesus called Apostles during His time on earth. “The Book of Mormon is one way God has confirmed to me the truth of what we have said. The purpose of the Book of Mormon is to convince all people that Jesus is the Christ, and acts as an additional testament of Him with The Bible.</p>
